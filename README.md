CO661 Assessment 1 - Concurrent File Server

There is a test suite that Dominic Orchard provided. Running instructions are:

1. Move into `src` with `cd src/`
2. Compile MyFileServer with `javac MyFileServer.java`
3. Compile with `javac TestSuite.java`
4. Run with `java TestSuite MyFileServer`

But the tests are not exhaustive, so bear that in mind.

If you want to test the Example `Client` included, then run the following:

1. Move into `src` if not already there with `cd src/`
2. Compile MyFileServer with `javac MyFileServer.java`
3. Compile Client with `javac Client.java`
4. Run with `java Client`
